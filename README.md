# Appointment Finder

This application takes different peoples daily
calendars and compares them to find suitable meeting
times that everyone can attend. Each user must create a 
calendar with a set earliest avaiable time, and a latest
available time. The user wanting to compare calendars 
must add his coworkers to his contact list, define the 
length of the meeting from the given options (15, 30, 60 
minutes) and the interval in which it should be created 
i.e. 15 minute meeting within a 1 hour slot. The application then
returns a list of possible meetings, or a message informing
them that an appointment cannot be made.
